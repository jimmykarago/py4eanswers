# py4eanswers
I'm learning how to program through the python for everybody course by Dr.Chuck. I do understand that some of the answers are not available online for some excercises. This repository is an attempt to answer some questions not easily found online. I'm still learning if I do make a mistake please correct me. Also the answers should be used as guide to see where you might have gone wrong.
